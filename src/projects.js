        description: ` 
        In order to encourage people to recycle more, we created a game with super cute animals that all need saving. 
        Our app uses a tensorflow model trained using Microsoft Azure to identify if an item is recyclable or not. The more they reycle,
        the more points they get, and the more animals they can unlock on the path to restoring the ecosystem! This was a team project
        created in a 17 hour sprint for Hack The North 2019, and although the final product is not perfect, it was an awesome learning 
        experience.

        We built both a graphical interface for playing the game using XQuartz, as well as a textual version in the terminal. The functionalities
        of our game include all the basics of Tetris along with increasingly difficult levels, special effects and actions to make the game more competitive. 
        Our implementation uses various design patterns such as MVC, Observer, and Factory. Overall, I learned a lot from working on this project 
        and it was super fun to make!`,

        The first version of my website was a complete mess (the opposite of user friendly and mobile friendly), and I am constantly trying to improve it!
        I've learned a lot since then including how to make my app scalable, and taking more into consideration the user experience. I

        computer science course, and developing this game is what kickstarted my interest in game development! It was built using Java Swing, 
        and I had so much fun designing the UI to be Kingdom Hearts themed (my fave video game). I have matured a lot as a developer since then, 
        and I've realized that the code for this game is definitely FAR, far from perfect (or even good to be honest), but developing this game
        was one of the biggest contributors to the decision I made to major in CS, so I'm keeping it here to honour it.`,
